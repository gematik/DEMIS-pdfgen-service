/**
 * Provides unified access to address information for a notified person and others for use in
 * templates. <br>
 * <br>
 * The type of address information differs based on origin. A notified person that references
 * address information of an organization will include telecomunication data, contact person and
 * more. A regular postal address attached to a notified person doesn't carry that data. <br>
 * <br>
 * To be able to render the correct address information we need to retrieve information from an
 * organization. At the same time we want to be able to sort all addresses for a person based on use
 * to provide a determinate order. By default this is not possible when an address is hidden in an
 * organization. <br>
 * <br>
 * We can achieve both goals by wrapping organization-based address information and regular address
 * information and then exposing a unified interface for use in templates.
